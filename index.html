<h2>1. What is Roblox Scripting?</h2>

    <p><h4>Roblox scripting uses and coding language called lua.<br> 
    Lua is just like all the other languages such as Javascript, Python etc.<br>
    In this webiste i will tell you how to script in roblox!</p></h4>


    <h2 id = "norequire1">The Basics (Coding = Not Required) </h2>
    <p>So you want to know how to code? First you need to know the basics.<br>
    You need to know how to put a part. So you go to to home tab on the top left <br>
    click on it and then you will see a button called part. Click on it and a part will <br>
    appear on your baseplate!</p>


<h2 id = "norequire2">Properties (Coding = Not Required)</h2>

    <p>You want to change how the part you just made? We got you. Go to the Explorer <br>
    section and select it. Notice that your part is in the section called "Baseplate" <br>
    the part you put is the child of the baseplate and the baseplate is the parent of <br>
    your part. The baseplate is the child of the "workspace" The Workspace should always <br>
    be the parent of everything including the parts, baseplate and even the scripts which we <br>
    will get on later. So select the part and then click the "Properties" tab. The tab is in <br>
    the Explorer. When you click on the tab, you will be able to change the color and change if <br>
    part is collidable or not so test it out!</p>
